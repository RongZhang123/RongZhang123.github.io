    <p class="muted">
      I am a PhD Candidate in Agricultural Economics at Texas A&M University. My research interests lie in empirical industrial organization and applied microeconomics, with a particular emphasis on price discrimination, market structure, consumer behavior and inequality. The overarching goal of my doctoral dissertation is to better understand the mechanisms of price discrimination and consumer behavior dynamics.
