        <h5 class="paper-title">Price Discrimination and Implicit Market Segmentation in Consumer Packaged Goods</h5>
        <div class="muted">Job Market Paper, with Yvette Zhang</div>
        <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> 
          Implicit market segmentation is a marketing and pricing practice in which firms use indirect cues, such as product design, packaging or branding, to segment the market based on inferred preferences, rather than on explicit observable characteristics. This practice is widely used in consumer packaged goods and it can involve both second-degree and third-degree price discrimination, which together can generate ambiguous welfare effects. Yet most existing empirical studies consider these two forms of price discrimination separately, leaving open the question of how they interact when deployed together. In this paper, we employ a random-coefficient aggregate discrete choice model to asses the price discrimination pattern and welfare effects of implicit market segmentation. The empirical estimation analyzes implicit market segmentation in consumer packaged goods using scanner data of toothbrush market. We find that the implicit market segmentation lead to price differences across markets, and the differences are jointly sustained by third-degree and second-degree price discrimination. By conducting a counterfactual analysis, we find that eliminating the segmentation would increase consumer surplus but reduce producer surplus, resulting in a net welfare gain. 
        <h5 class="paper-title">Educational Assortative Matching and Income Inequality in China</h5>
        <div class="muted">With Song Zhou and Yvette Zhang</div>
        <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;"><strong>Abstract:</strong>The fast increase of the income inequality in China had attracted worldwide attention, one of the causes of the increasing income inequality can be the assortative matching in marriage market. This paper examines how educational assortative matching affects household income inequality in China. Using a national representative survey data from 2010 to 2018, we document a growing tendency for spouses to match by education. We simulate two hypothetical scenarios—random and perfect matching—to quantify the impact of sorting on inequality. Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients show that educational sorting substantially raises inequality. In most developed countries, assortative matching can contribute to the income inequality through married female labor force participation. Thus we also simulate changes in women’s labor force behavior. We consider both extensive and intensive margin of labor market. While the extensive margin in China remains high by global standards, the intensive margin has experienced substantial changes. However, the results find that their effects on inequality are modest. These results indicate that marital sorting played a more substantial role in increasing household income inequality than shifts in post-marriage labor supply.</p>
